"""
A Ranked Voting System is a system that chooses a result based on a ranked-preference rather 
than a simple majority. A standard ranked ballot generally has multiple choices, only one of 
which one can be picked. A ranked ballot allows you to choose the order in which you prefer 
candidates. An example could be that you prefer choice B first, then choice C, and finally 
choice A.

There are some neat implications on how this differs from conventional voting systems, and 
is used in many different countries and states (check out the same article's list of current 
uses on the overall system; well worth a watch! The overall difference between the two system 
is that a more agreed-upon candidate could win during a heavily split election.

Your goal is to take a list of candidates and voter's ballots, implement this voting 
system (using the Instant-runoff rules), and print the results of the fictional election.

Input Description
=================
On standard console input, you will be given two space-delimited integers, N and M. N is 
the number of votes, while M is the number of candidates. After this line, you will be given 
the candidates line, which is a space-delimited set of M-number of candidate names. These 
names are one-word lower-case letters only. This is followed by N-lines of ballots, where 
each ballot is a list of M-integers, from 0 to M-1, representing the order of preference.

Note that the order of preference for ballots goes from left-to-right. The integers are the 
index into the candidate list. For the example below, you can 
map 0: Knuth, 1: Turing, 2: Church. This means that if the ballot row is "1 0 2", that means 
the voter prefers Turing over Knuth over Church.

Output Description
==================
Given the candidates and ballots, compute the first-round of successful candidates (e.g. rank 
them based on all ballot's first choice). If the percentage of votes for any one candidate 
is more than 50%, print the candidate name as the winner. Else, take all the votes of the 
least-successful candidate, and use their ballot's 2nd choice, summing again the total votes. 
If needed (e.g. there is no candidate that has more than 50% of the votes), repeat this 
process for the 3rd, 4th, etc. choice, and print the winner of the election.

For each round of computation, print the percentage of votes for each candidate, and rank 
them based on that percentage, using the output format.

Sample Inputs
=============
5 3
Knuth Turing Church
1 0 2
0 1 2
2 1 0
2 1 0
1 2 0

Sample Outputs
==============
Round 1: 40.0% Turing, 40.0% Church, 20.0% Knuth
Round 2: 60.0% Turing, 40.0% Church
Turing is the winner
