"""
You must write code that verifies the awarded points for a fictional sport are valid. This sport 
is a simplification of American Football scoring rules. This means that the score values must be 
any logical combination of the following four rewards:

  6 points for a "touch-down"
  3 points for a "field-goal"
  1 point for an "extra-point"; can only be rewarded after a touch-down. Mutually-exclusive 
  with "two-point conversion"
  2 points for a "two-point conversion"; can only be rewarded after a touch-down. Mutually-
  exclusive with "extra-point"

A valid score could be 7, which can come from a single "touch-down" and then an "extra-point". 
Another example could be 6, from either a single "touch-down" or two "field-goals". 4 is not a 
valid score, since it cannot be formed by any well-combined rewards.

Input Description
=================
Input will consist of a single positive integer given on standard console input.

Output Description
==================
Print "Valid Score" or "Invalid Score" based on the respective validity of the given score.

Sample Input 1
==============
